=============== vlc-srt-urlparam-mod ===============
A modified version of VLC 3.0.x which adds support for SRT query parameters.

========== Supported Parameters ==========

- `streamid`

========== Notice ==========
This is uncompiled source code! Meaning you will have to compile VLC yourself in order to be able to use this modification.

========== Using this yourself (Ubuntu) ==========
This is not a perfect step-by-step guide, only the basic information required to get it working. I built and use this on Linux, your results may vary.

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/IRLToolkit/vlc-srt-urlparam-mod.git`
- You must remove any existing version of vlc and libvlc via apt and/or snap.
- Uncomment the `deb-src` line for `universe` in your `/etc/apt/sources.list`, then run `sudo apt update`
- Install all necessary VLC dependencies with `sudo apt build-dep vlc` and `sudo apt install git build-essential pkg-config libtool automake autopoint gettext`
- CD into the cloned repository and run `./bootstrap`, then `./configure`, then assuming it works run `make -j4`. Compiling will take a while.
- To install it onto your system, run `sudo make install`, and then `sudo ldconfig`.

And you should be done! Here's an example SRT URL containing a `streamid` parameter: `srt://123.123.123.123:6969?streamid=app/streamname`

README for the VLC media player
===============================

VLC is a popular libre and open source media player and multimedia engine,
used by a large number of individuals, professionals, companies and
institutions. Using open source technologies and libraries, VLC has been
ported to most computing platforms, including GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X,
BSD, iOS and Android.
VLC can play most multimedia files, discs, streams, allows playback from
devices, and is able to convert to or stream in various formats.
The VideoLAN project was started at the university Ã‰cole Centrale Paris who
relicensed VLC under the GPLv2 license in February 2001. Since then, VLC has
been downloaded close to one billion times.
